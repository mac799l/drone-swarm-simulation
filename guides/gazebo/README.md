## Gazebo Guides
The guides in this folder are the following:

`gazebo_setup` covers the installation and initial setup for a simple testing environment in Gazebo using simple Mavproxy commands.

`gazebo_cameras` details the configuration, activation, streaming, and receiving of camera data from each drone in the environment.

`gazebo_drone_swarm` follows the set up process I used to add multiple drones to a Gazebo environment.
